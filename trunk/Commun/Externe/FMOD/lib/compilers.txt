Which library do I link?
------------------------

If you want to use fmodex64.dll

Visual Studio users          - fmodex64_vc.lib.


If you want to use fmodexL64.dll: (same as fmodex64.dll but with debug logging enabled)

Visual Studio users          - fmodexL64_vc.lib.


No other compilers are supported for 64bit libraries.
